# Arch Example

## Branch `step-1-scaffold`
This **ArchEX5** project has branches that show the result of doing blocks of steps. Branch `step-1-scaffold` is the result of minimally scaffolding out the project
1. from `GOROOT` which for me is `~/go`, create a folder under `github.com/[user]/[project]`. This is the project root folder
2. initialize a git repo here
2. touch `go.mod`, add one line `go 1.15`
3. create hello world `main.go` in project root
